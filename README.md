# Dominick's Finer Foods Data Warehousing Project

This repository contains all the necessary resources, documentation, and implementation artifacts for the **Dominick's Finer Foods Data Warehousing Project**. The project is aimed at providing data-driven solutions to optimize retail operations, answer critical business questions, and enable efficient decision-making through advanced analytics.


## Project Overview

Dominick's Finer Foods (DFF) was a leading grocery chain in Chicago, known for its high-quality meat and produce. However, following its acquisition, the chain faced challenges that led to a decline in market share. This project was initiated to design a robust **data warehouse** solution to address these issues and provide actionable insights. 

### Objectives:
1. Design and implement a scalable data warehouse.
2. Answer key **Business Questions (BQs)** for operational and strategic insights.
3. Utilize **Kimball's dimensional modeling approach** for independent data marts.
4. Implement and automate **ETL processes** using **SSIS packages**.
5. Provide BI reports using tools like **Tableau**, **SSRS**, and **SSAS**.


## Repository Contents

### 1. **Final Report**
